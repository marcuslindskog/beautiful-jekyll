I'm a senior researcher at the [Uppsala Child and Babylab](http://www.babylab.se) at the [Department of Psychology, Uppsala University](http://www.psyk.uu.se)

The overarching goal of my research is to understand the processes involved when people use numerical information. In my research I integrate perspectives from cognitive psychology, psychophysics, and developmental psychology. My work has to main tracks. In the first I investigate the properties of a primitive cognitive system, the Approximate Number System (ANS), that can be found already in infants and that is thought to be the foundation of later mathematical abilities. The other track investigates how infants and adults extract and process statistical regularities in their environment in order to do intuitive statistical judgments. In my work with infants I mainly work with eye-tracking and behavioral observations.
