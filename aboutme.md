I'm a senior lecturer at [Department of Education](http://www.edu.uu.se) at Uppsala University. I'm also a senior researcher at the [Uppsala Child and Babylab](http://www.babylab.se) in the same university. 

I study development in *Learning* and *Cognition* with a special interest in the processes involved when children and adults learn mathematics and use use numebers.

In my research I integrate perspectives from cognitive psychology, psychophysics, and developmental psychology. I work with a wide range of methods, including eye-tracking, EEG, computerized experiments, behavioral observations, and computational modeling.
